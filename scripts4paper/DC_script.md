# DC_script

## Preparing (new in May 2021)

It should be noted that this May 2021 version will only support CASA 6.

First an outline how to use the scripts in this directory:

1) Before using these scripts, you will need to configure to set the script, data and working directory
for your scripts to use your own directories, as oppsed to the current one.
You need to execute the **configure** script from the scripts4paper directory, e.g.


      ./configure  --with-s4p-work=tmp  --with-s4p-data=../data

will use the current tmp directory (which will be created for you) for your working files, and ../data as the
directory were all the data are located (at least for the DC2019 project). Use the --help argument to find out
what other options might be useful for you. What is listed here are the defaults.

2) The second step will be to pick a parameter file. Several should be available from a template, for
example for the GMC dataset

       cp  DC_pars_GMC.py  DC_pars.py
	   
after which you can change various parameters (see also USER INPUTS below)  in this **DC_pars.py**.

3a) Make sure your CASA environment has been set up

       execfile("/home/teuben/dc2019/scripts4paper/DC_locals.py")

it is best to place your version of this line in your **~/.casa/startup.py** file

3a) From your CASA session you will use DC_script.py (it will call DC_pars and DC_run):

       execfile("DC_script.py")

this will do the whole data combination as specified by the many USER INPUTS.
	   

## DC_script overview

The **DC_script.py** uses the **datacomb.py** module to conveniently combine 
your data. The DC_script's goal is to provide a homogeneous input to all 
combination methods (e.g. clean parameters) and a homogeneous output 
style.

It offers several different actions to be selected via the python 'thesteps' list set in **DC_pars.py**

      0: 'Concat',
      1: 'Prepare the SD-image and create masks',
      2: 'Clean for Feather/Faridani'
      3: 'Feather', 
      4: 'Faridani short spacings combination (SSC)',
      5: 'Hybrid (startmodel clean + Feather)',
      6: 'SDINT',
      7: 'TP2VIS'

The naming scheme of the output images is the following

      imname = imbase + cleansetup + combisetup

- imbase     - a basename you define
- cleansetup - defined by your tclean parameter choice
- combisetup - defined by your combination method and parameter choice

Various **USER INPUTS** are described below, which you should all find in **DC_pars.py**


## USER INPUTS: Paths to the input and output files and for concatenation of several ms - data sets

      pathtoconcat = 'path-to-ms-datasets-(array-configs)-and-SD-image-to-combine'   
      # path to the folder with the files to be concatenated
      
      pathtoimage  = 'path-to-your-products'                         
      # path to the folder where to put the combination and image results
      
      concatms     = pathtoimage + 'skymodel-b_120L.alma.all_int-weighted.ms'       
      # path and name of concatenated file (e.g. blabla.ms)

The list of files to concatenate is defined in this section, too, 
as well as the visweighting.

If you don't need/want to concatenate data, give the name and path 
of the file or a list of files you want to image directly to concatms 
and skip thesteps=[0].

      
   
## USER INPUTS: files and names used by the combination methods 
      
      vis       = concatms 
      sdimage   = pathtoconcat + 'gmc_120L.sd.image'
      imbase    = pathtoimage + 'skymodel-b_120L'            # path + image base name
      sdbase    = pathtoimage + 'skymodel-b_120L_TP'         # path + sd image base name


## USER INPUTS:  TP2VIS related setup

TPpointingTemplate is an ALMA 12m dataset used in the combination, listobsOutput 
holds the information that listobs produces, TPpointinglist contains the antenna 
pointings read out from the listobsOutput. If these are not provided the user can 
use his own pointing list. 

      TPpointingTemplate        = a12m[0]        
      listobsOutput             = imbase+'.12m.log'
      TPpointinglist            = imbase+'.12m.ptg'
      TPpointinglistAlternative = 'user-defined.ptg'   
 
For transforming the SD image into visibilities, TP2VIS needs the rms in the SD images 
for setting the weights. Therefore, one has to specify a range of emission-free pixels 
in a continuum SD image, or a range of emission-free channels in the SD cube.

      TPnoiseRegion   = '10,30,10,30'  # emission free box in unregridded continuum SD image!
      TPnoiseChannels = '2~5'          # emission free channels in unregridded and un-cut SD cube!


##  USER INPUTS: setup of the clean parameters

With this section, we set up the clean parameters common for all tclean 
instances used in the combination methods including SDINT.

       general_tclean_param  - present in all methods
       sdint_tclean_param    - only given in runsdintimg

Before setting the parameters included above, we can generate a meaningful 
file name "infix" to attach 
to the imbase, reflecting the relevant clean properties (you define). 
Currently, mode, mscale, masking, inter, nit, and specsetup define the 
infix name: e.g.

       mode      = 'mfs'      # 'mfs' or 'cube'
       mscale    = 'HB'       # 'MS' (multiscale) or 'HB' (hogbom; MTMFS in SDINT!)) 
       masking   = 'SD-AM'    # 'UM' (user mask), 'SD-AM' (SD+AM mask)), 'AM' ('auto-multithresh') or 'PB' (primary beam)
       inter     = 'nIA'      # interactive ('IA') or non-interactive ('nIA')
       nit       = 0          # max = 9.9 * 10**9 
       specsetup = 'INTpar'   # 'SDpar' (use SD cube's spectral setup) or 'INTpar' (user defined cube setup, only option for 'mfs')



Using an infix-definition of

       cleansetup = '.'+ mode +'_'+ specsetup +'_'+ mscale +'_'+ masking +'_'+ inter +'_n'+ str(nit)

gives us 
 
       cleansetup = '.mfs_INTpar_HB_AM_nIA_n1000'


This infix-definition could be made more flexible.
Maybe introduce a loop over some clean parameters like niter.


For "SDpar" we can also define a channel-cut-out from the SD image to 
reduce channel range translated into the combined product

       startchan = 30  #None  # start-value of the SD image channel range you want to cut out 
       endchan   = 39  #None  #   end-value of the SD image channel range you want to cut out

Generating a common mask from an SD image mask and an auto-multithreshold mask
or user defined threshold (masking  = 'SD-AM'), requires additional input:

       smoothing  = 5    # smoothing of the threshold mask (by 'smoothing x beam')
       RMSfactor  = 0.5  # continuum rms level (not noise from emission-free regions but entire image)
       cube_rms   = 3    # cube noise (true noise) x this factor
       cont_chans = ''   # line free channels for cube rms estimation
       sdmasklev  = 0.3  # maximum x this factor = threshold for SD mask



##  USER INPUTS: SD scaling in combination

Here, we can list multiple scaling factors per scaling parameter 
(e.g sdfac=[0.8, 1.0, 1.2] for feather) for the corresponding 
combination method to iterate over. Default could be 1.0 for all.


##  USER INPUTS: dryrun

dryrun=True: It generates the filennames with the wanted 
iterators and cleannames without executing the combination method (time saving).



## automated setup: naming scheme specific inputs

Translate the abbreviated clean properties used in the user clean setup 
into real tclean parameters. Define the filename-'infix':

       cleansetup = '.'+ mode +'_'+ specsetup +'_'+ mscale +'_'+ masking +'_'+ inter +'_n'+ str(nit)


## automated setup: suffix for combination method (called via combisetup later)

Here, we define the suffix for each method. The scaling factor iterator 
will be added in the corresponding combination loop.


## automated setup: intermediate products name for step 1 = gather information 

In this section, intermediate file names such as for the axis-reordered, 
the potential channel-range-cut-out of an SD cube,
and regridded SD images are defined.
The chosen mask setup is translated into CASA parameters 
and the several mask names (threshold based, SD-AM based and combined) 
are defined and forwarded to the different combination methods.
File existence checks initiate the execution of 'step 1', if one of the 
here defined files does not exist and step 1 is not yet included in the 
list of execution steps.
The choice of the 'specsetup'-parameter sets the tclean parameters 'start', 
'width', and 'nchans' either to the spectral setup of the SD image 
(specsetup == 'SDpar') or to the user defined spectral setup (specsetup == 'INTpar').
The SDimage used in the combination methods is the 
axis-reordered-(channel-cut-out-)only-image 
or the axis-reordered-(channel-cut-out-)regridded-image, respectively.
If no threshold is given and a threshold-based mask exists from previous runs, 
the threshold used therein is retreived from it again, else step 1 is enforced.



## automated setup: combi name list

This section initiates lists in which the names of the combined images 
are dropped. This can be used for the assessment task to select the wanted 
products. In case the user wants to redefine the selection within this 
module, he can use dryrun=True (see above).



## execution steps/methods

### step 0: concat

If you want to combine several interferometric datasets specify 
'thevis', 'weighscale', 'concatms' and add 0 to your 'thestep'-list 



### step 1: SD image and tclean/mask preparation

1) the axes of the SD image are sorted according to the tclean 
   output standard order (reorder_axes).

2) if in specmode='SDpar' and start and end channel are defined, 
   the SD cube is trimmed to these channels (exclusively; channel_cutout).

3) the channel setup of the reordered (channel-cut-out0) SD cube is read out (get_SD_cube_params). 
   If wanted, the results are used as inputs for all following tcleans etc (need to implement!).

4) a dirty image from the concatvis is created and the RMS of the entire image obtained. 
   This is used to define a threshold and from this a clean mask (derive_threshold).

5) the dirty image is used as template to regrid the reordered SD image (imregrid).

6) a mask from the reordered-regridded SD image is created and combined 
   with auto-masking results in tclean (make_SDint_mask).

7) combine theshold and SD mask, because the theshold mask may 
   contain more/different emission peaks than auto-masking (immath).


### step 2: tclean only

       imname = imbase + cleansetup + tcleansetup
       e.g.     skymodel-b_120L.HB_AM_n0.0e0.tclean


### step 3: feather

Requires restoringbeam='common'! perplanebeam-problems

      imname = imbase + cleansetup + feathersetup + str(sdfac[i]) 
      e.g.     skymodel-b_120L.HB_AM_n0.0e0.feather_f1.0


### step 4: SSC

      imname = imbase + cleansetup + SSCsetup + str(SSCfac[i]) 
      e.g.     skymodel-b_120L.HB_AM_n0.0e0.SSC_f1.0


### step 5: hybrid

      imname = imbase + cleansetup + hybridsetup + str(sdfac_h[i]) 
      e.g.     skymodel-b_120L.HB_AM_n0.0e0.hybrid_f1.0


### step 6: SDINT 

      jointname = imbase + cleansetup + sdintsetup + str(sdg[i]) 
      e.g.     skymodel-b_120L.HB_AM_n0.0e0.sdint_g1.0


### step 7: TP2VIS

      imname = imbase + cleansetup + TP2VISsetup + str(TPfac[i]) 
      e.g.     skymodel-b_120L.HB_AM_n0.0e0.TP2VIS_t1.0


## after combination loops

delete the nasty TempLattices (this is a CASA bug and should be reported that somebody
is not cleaning up)
